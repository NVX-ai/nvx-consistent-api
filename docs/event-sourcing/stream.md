# Stream
The source of information for an [entity](../framework/entity.md). A stream is a ledger containing every event that has happened in the system that relates to the concept at hand.

The "on duty" stream for a military base watchtower, would have a log of the start and end of every guard's shift, replies to status control, and any suspicious activity registered by the guards.
